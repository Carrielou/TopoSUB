# TopoSUB
R package for the TopoSUB Tool
* preprocessing
* postprocessing
* data analysis

TopoSUB is a R project for sampling the most important aspects of land surface heterogeneity through a lumped scheme, allowing for the application of numerical land surface models (LSMs), like e.g. [GEOtop](https://github.com/skyglobe/geotop), over large areas in mountain regions or other heterogeneous environments (Fiddes et al. 2012).
