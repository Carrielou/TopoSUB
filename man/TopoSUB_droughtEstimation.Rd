\title{
Sequential dry days of a SMC series modeled with TopoSUB/GEOtop
}
\description{
Calculates number of sequential dry days ("drought" duration D), intensity (I), and severity (S) of a soil moisture time series. Climatic periods of 30 years are conducted, baseline is covering the first 30 years of the time series. Method adapted from Sheffield & Wood (2008). 
}
\usage{
TopoSUB_droughtEstimation(data_)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data_}{
data table, soil moisture output TopoSUB/GEOtop simulation, expected columns: Date, IDpoint, SMC
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
list containing output from function \emph{TopoSUB_droughtEstim} for each climate period, starting with the baseline period and proceeding with an one year moving window towards the last 30 years of the time series.
